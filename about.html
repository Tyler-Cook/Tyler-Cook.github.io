                    <p>A bit about me... I attended the Fulton School of Engineering at Arizona State University from 2021–2023 studying full stack web development. After starting my Junior year, I got a part-time job at National Technology Integrators (NTI) as an Operations Specialist, which, due to lucky timing, quickly turned into me starting the IT department. I had no experience in IT and am just generally computer-savvy, but due to my development experience, it was a case of computer = computer. It was at this point I was offered a promotion as a System Administrator and made the decision to put school on pause.</p>
                    <br>
		            <p>After stepping into the System Administrator role, I spent the next two and a half years building out the foundation of our internal IT operations. I introduced new tools, standardized workflows, and created processes that made day-to-day support smoother for our office staff. As the company expanded, I helped lead the onboarding and integration of a newly acquired sister company, making sure their team had a seamless transition into our systems. It’s been incredibly rewarding to watch the department grow from something I helped spark into a fully established part of the organization, and I'm grateful I was able to contribute to NTI's momentum and evolution.</p>
		            <br>
                    <p>In March of 2025, I made the decision to move on from IT and pursue a goal I always thought was out of reach: Game Development. I returned to school at the University of Maryland Global Campus and will finish my BS in Game Design and Minor in Computer Science in May of 2026. I have engine-shopped quite a bit in the last two years and have experience in Godot, Unity 6, and Unreal Engine 5, with UE5 being my preference and focus point for development.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Games have always been more than entertainment for me. The deeper I’ve gone into development, the more I’ve come to appreciate just how many disciplines come together to bring a single moment of gameplay to life. Art, engineering, design, storytelling, planning, iteration; it’s a collaboration of creativity and problem-solving that's inspiring. Being part of that process motivates me. I want to help create experiences that make people feel something, explore something, or simply escape for a moment. With that drive in mind, I’m seeking game design roles that let me collaborate, learn, and help bring new ideas to life.</p>
